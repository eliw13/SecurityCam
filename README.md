# SecurityCam
A simple python program to record security cam footage by detecting a face and body of a person in the frame.

This code was created by me, but following tutorials and learning more about haarscascades.

One issue I am noticing is that whenever the face leaves the frame, the program is supposed to stop the recording. It continues recording until the user presses 'q' to stop the program.
